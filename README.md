# Real_Time_Face_Detection

📌 Overview:
This project demonstrates real-time face detection using the OpenCV (cv2) library and Haar Cascade Classifier. It captures video input through a webcam (or any connected camera) and applies pre-trained classifiers to detect human faces within live video frames. The detected faces are highlighted with bounding boxes, making it an effective example of computer vision in action.

🚀 Features:
1.Real-time face detection from a webcam feed.

2.Utilizes Haar Cascade Frontal Face Classifier for high accuracy.

3.Lightweight and easy-to-implement Python solution.

4.Can be extended for facial recognition or emotion detection projects.

🛠️ Technologies Used:
1.Python 3.x
2.OpenCV (cv2) library
3.Haar Cascade Classifier (haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml)

🎯 Usage:
1.The program will start the webcam and detect faces in real time.

2.Faces are displayed with bounding boxes for easy visualization.

3.Press 'a' to exit the application.

📌 Future Enhancements:
1.Add smile or eye detection.

2.Implement facial recognition using LBPH, DNNs, or deep learning models.

3.Deploy on mobile or IoT devices for surveillance applications.
